# Data Structures and Algorithms - Another Last Resort for saving your career

This GitHub repository that holds the questionable honour of being your last bastion of hope in the murky, swampy waters of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). If you've stumbled upon this forsaken land, it probably means you've either exhausted every other resource on the internet or you've got a thing for digital self-harm. Either way, buckle up, buttercup - it's going to be a bumpy ride.

## What Is This Monstrosity?

This repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms with solutions to various problems found across the internet so elegantly complicated and unnecessarily convoluted that even the creators have a hard time understanding what's going on.

This is where code readability goes to die, and where your hopes of quickly learning DSA are mercilessly crushed.

## Features

- Comprehensive Confusion: From basic to advanced data structures, we've got it all, tangled in a web of complexity that would make even a seasoned developer weep.

- Algorithms Galore: Enjoy a vast array of algorithms presented in the most obfuscated manner possible, because who needs clarity when you can have chaos?

  - Comments? LOL: Seeking inline comments for clarity? You're hilarious. This is where you learn the hard way, through the ancient art of trial and error.

  - Examples? Maybe: Find a smattering of examples that may or may not work, depending on the phase of the moon and our mood during the last commit.

  - Contribution Guidelines: Feel like contributing? Prepare for your pull requests to languish in purgatory because we're probably too salty to bother.

  Installation

  Stare at the code until despair sets in.
  Consider why you chose a career in software.
  Go back to step 2 as needed.

## Usage

Usage? Oh, sweet mother of god... This isn't the kind of repository that holds your hand and gently guides you through. Here, you dive into the abyss and hope you emerge with some semblance of understanding. Or not. I'm not responsible for any loss of sanity, hair, or self-esteem.

## Contributing

Got an unnecessarily complex algorithm? A data structure so esoteric that no one in their right mind would use it? Perfect. Throw it into a pull request, and we might ignore it for a couple of months before closing it without comment. Your suffering fuels us.

## Final Words

If you've read this far, congratulations! You're either very determined or exceptionally masochistic. Either way, SaltyDSA welcomes you with open, albeit grudging, arms. Good luck, you'll need it.
