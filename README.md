# Data Structures and Algorithms - Another Last Resort for saving your career

This repository that holds the questionable honor of being your last bastion of hope in the murky, swampy waters of [Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure).

If you've stumbled upon this forsaken land, it probably means you've either exhausted every other resource on the internet or you've got a thing for digital self-harm. Either way, buckle up, buttercup - it's going to be a bumpy ride.

## What Is This Monstrosity?

This repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms with solutions to various problems found across the internet so elegantly complicated and unnecessarily convoluted that even the creators have a hard time understanding what's going on.

This is where code readability goes to die, and where your hopes of quickly learning DSA are mercilessly crushed.

## TECH INTERVIEWS - The DSA Advantage (Or How to Scare Your Interviewers)

Ah, tech interviews - the gladiator arenas of the modern era, where hopeful candidates battle with the sword of knowledge and the shield of problem-solving. Fear not, brave warrior, for DSA has prepared you in the most unconventional, borderline masochistic manner possible. Here's how this repository can "help" you leave a lasting impression (for better or worse):

**Impress with Incomprehensibility**'

_Speak in Complexities_: After spending time with DSA, you'll be fluent in the arcane language of overly complex solutions. When asked to reverse a linked list, why settle for the mundane when you can propose a solution involving quantum computing and interdimensional hash maps?

**Bewilder with Buzzwords**

_Confuse and Conquer_: Utilize the bewildering jargon you've picked up here to answer questions with such perplexing verbosity that interviewers are too embarrassed to admit they have no idea what you're talking about. "Ah, you see, by leveraging a bidirectional cyclical graph traversal, we can optimize the space-time continuum complexity..."

**The Element of Surprise**

_Shock Value_: Use algorithms and data structures that are so out of left field, they leave everyone in the room questioning the nature of reality itself. Who cares about efficiency when you can be memorable? "For this sorting problem, I suggest we employ the Rube Goldberg Machine Sort - it's inefficient, but it'll be an interview they'll never forget."

**Build Resilience**

_Embrace the Despair_: DSA ensures that you've already faced the darkest depths of confusion and frustration during your preparation. The actual interview will feel like a gentle breeze after a hurricane.

**Contribution as a Conversation Starter**

_I Contributed to DSA_: Mentioning your contributions to a repository as notorious as DSA could be a unique conversation starter. It shows you have a sense of humor (or a high tolerance for pain), and you're willing to tackle challenges head-on, even if they're slightly absurd.

## FEATURES

- **Comprehensive Confusion**: From basic to advanced data structures, you've got it all, tangled in a web of complexity that would make even a seasoned developer weep.

- **Algorithms Galore**: Enjoy a vast array of algorithms presented in the most obfuscated manner possible, because who needs clarity when you can have chaos

- **Comments? LOL**: Seeking inline comments for clarity? You're hilarious. This is where you learn the hard way, through the ancient art of trial and error.

- **Examples?** _Maybe_: Find a smattering of examples that may or may not work, depending on the phase of the moon and our mood during the last commit.

- **Contribution Guidelines**: Feel like contributing? Prepare for your pull requests to languish in purgatory because I'm probably too salty to bother.

### INSTALLATION

1. Clone this repository.
2. Stare at the code until despair sets in.
3. Consider why you chose a career in software.
4. Go back to step 2 as needed.

### USAGE

Usage? Oh, sweet mother of god... This isn't the kind of repository that holds your hand and gently guides you through. Here, you dive into the abyss and hope you emerge with some semblance of understanding. Or not. I'm not responsible for any loss of sanity, hair, or self-esteem.

### CONTRIBUTING

Got an unnecessarily complex algorithm? A data structure so esoteric that no one in their right mind would use it? Perfect. Throw it into a pull request, and we might ignore it for a couple of months before closing it without comment. Your suffering fuels us.

### LICENSE

This repository is released under the "Do Whatever You Want But Don't Blame Us" license. We're not responsible for the damage this repository may inflict upon your psyche or career prospects.

### DISCLAIMER : USE AT YOUR RISK!

While I jest about the "benefits" of using the code contained for interview prep, I must include a small disclaimer: Using overly complex solutions in interviews can be risky. It's essential to balance impressing your interviewers with practical, efficient solutions and showcasing your problem-solving skills.

However, a little humor and creativity can sometimes set you apart in a sea of candidates.

Remember, tech interviews are as much about showing your problem-solving approach and ability to communicate as they are about finding the "right" answer.

So, go forth with the confidence of someone who's navigated the chaotic seas of DSA and lived to tell the tale. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.

### FINAL WORDS

If you've read this far, **congratulations!** You're either very determined or exceptionally masochistic. Either way, I welcome you with open, albeit grudging, arms. Good luck, you'll need it.
